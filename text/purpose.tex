The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how it is possible to adapt an existing free-list-based allocator for use within ZGC, and to evaluate the effects of these adaptations on allocator performance. The goal is to leverage insights of this work to direct subsequent efforts in the domain of free-list-based allocators in garbage collection.


The research questions this thesis seeks to answer are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What changes are neccesary when adapting an allocator for use within ZGC?
  \item Is it possible to leverage knowledge of integration into ZGC to improve allocator performance?
\end{enumerate}
