The rest of this thesis is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:introduction} outlines the purpose, goals, delimitations, and individual contributions. Section~\ref{sec:background} provides context on memory management, fragmentation, memory allocation strategies, and ZGC. Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork} reviews existing memory allocators and the use of free-lists in garbage collection. Section~\ref{sec:buddy} details the binary buddy allocator and its allocation, deallocation, and state determination methods. Section~\ref{sec:method} describes the implementation process, from reference design to evaluation. Section~\ref{sec:buddyadditions} introduces enhancements such as the binary tree and inverse buddy allocators. Section~\ref{sec:adaptations} discusses specific adaptations of the allocators for ZGC. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} outlines the performance and fragmentation testing approaches. Section~\ref{sec:results} presents the findings on page overhead, performance, and fragmentation. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} interprets these results, and Section~\ref{sec:futurework} suggests further research directions. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} summarizes key insights and their implications.
