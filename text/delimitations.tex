The primary delimitation of this thesis is the exclusion of allocator integration within ZGC. The focus is on examining the allocators and their adaptations independently. Pages in ZGC can be of three types: small, medium, or large. The modifications made focus solely on small pages, as these are the most common. However, insights gained from small pages may guide potential adaptations for medium and possibly large pages.
